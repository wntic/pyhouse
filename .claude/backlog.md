# Backlog — catalogue edits not yet made

Each entry is **Proposed** (awaiting the maintainer's decision) or **Agreed** (decided, not yet done).
Remove an entry in the change that does it; record the decision in `DECISIONS.md` as usual.

## Proposed

## Agreed

Item 55, agreed on 2026-10-04, remains. Every other agreed item has landed or was closed (D130–D161).

### 55. Performance obligations, placed with their owners
No `performance` skill: a bag of tips would restate rules other skills own. Two groups, each with an
owner. Language-level, a universal skill on async code: no blocking I/O or CPU-bound work inside a
coroutine (today one `## Other bindings` bullet in `hex-capability-adapter`), concurrency always
bounded, a client or pool built once per process rather than per call. Data access, in `persistence`:
no query per item in a loop, filtering and paging in the store rather than in Python, only the columns
and rows used, and every filter of a hot query backed by an index. Only what is expensive to retrofit
and checkable in review belongs; a micro-optimisation without a measurement does not. The maintainer
collects concrete findings from the lead's reviews first, and each becomes a rule.
