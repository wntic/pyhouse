# Backlog — catalogue edits not yet made

Each entry is **Proposed** (awaiting the maintainer's decision) or **Agreed** (decided, not yet done).
Remove an entry in the change that does it; record the decision in `DECISIONS.md` as usual.

## Agreed

87 waits until there are defects found after a change landed to run it on. Every other item has
landed or was closed (D130–D178, D191, D192, D195–D197).

### 87. A retrospective over released changes
`/retro`: the defects found after a change landed, which check each escaped, and the rule or test that
would close it — the loop D186 was the first output of. Deferred (D192) until such defects exist: in
the repository it would run on, most defects testing will find predate the pipeline, and half its
steps are gone.

## Proposed

### 88. Bound what `/change-review` reads in full on a large diff
Calibrated at about 3% of a five-hour window per review, and nearly twice that on a diff of 179 files,
of which it read about seventy in full (D187). A ceiling on full reads, or reading by lens question
rather than by file, would cut the cost of the largest diffs. To be measured with `/usage` on specs after
verify is gone, not by rerunning the calibration set; the fourteen that closed 104 took none (D195).
