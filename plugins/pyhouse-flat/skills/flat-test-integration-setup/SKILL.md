name: flat-test-integration-setup
description: Use when laying the shared fixtures a flat-layered service's integration tests rest on — the suite-owned datastore container, the exact-name safety guard any database the suite did not start must pass, the migration round trip, the session-scoped engine every fixture and test shares one event loop with, the rollback-scoped connection for code that accepts one, and the whole-schema wipe for code that opens its own transaction. Lives in the distribution's own `tests/integration/conftest.py`. Testing the data-access package against that datastore is `flat-test-persistence`; a hexagonal package's conftest hierarchy with a per-test dishka container is `hex-test-integration-setup`, in the `pyhouse-hex` plugin.
when_to_use: Also when asked where a flat service's test fixtures live, how integration tests get a real database, why a test suite must never truncate a developer's database, or why a session-scoped engine needs a session-scoped event loop.

# Flat-Layered Test — Integration Setup

Consult `test-principles` for the testing constitution. Where this skill contradicts `test-principles`, the constitution wins.

One-shot per distribution. Everything under its `tests/integration/` depends on this file: the datastore
the suite runs against, the migration history replayed onto it, the engine every test shares, and the two
isolation fixtures. **Its home is the distribution's own `tests/integration/conftest.py`.** A distribution
with no relational store takes none of this file.

**Two isolation fixtures, and which one a test uses follows from the declared transaction owner.** Every
callable in the data-access package either *accepts* a live connection and never commits, or *opens and owns*
one for the whole of its work (`persistence` rule 1). That declaration decides the fixture:

- **`conn`** — a rollback-scoped connection, for anything that *accepts* one: a function in the
  data-access package that takes one, and every assertion query. Fast, nothing reaches disk. Never for
  arranging rows that code which opens its own connection will read or write: those rows are
  uncommitted, so that code cannot see them, and a write to the same key waits on their lock until
  teardown. Such rows are written in `async with engine.begin()`, and `truncate_all` removes them.
- **`truncate_all`** — wipes every table after each test, for anything that *opens and owns* its
  transaction: repository classes, the work a trigger calls, and the wrappers above them. A test's outer transaction
  can neither see nor roll back a connection the code under test opened for itself.

## When to use vs. neighbours

- Laying or changing the fixtures themselves → this skill.
- The pytest configuration block that loads them → `python-toolchain`.
- A test of a table or the repository class → `flat-test-persistence`, which consumes both
  `conn` and `truncate_all` and lays none of its own.
- The work a trigger calls, its wrapper or the orchestration above them → `flat-test-run-function`; its code
  owns its transactions, so it takes the wipe.
- An external-system client's own test → `flat-test-service-client`; it needs no datastore and must not
  live under `tests/integration/`.
- Row builders → not this skill; they are module-level `def`s in the test file using them.
- What the data-access package under test contains, and which callables own their transactions →
  `flat-persistence`.
- Where members sit when several distributions share one repository, and the root configuration that
  registers a shared fixture module → `python-workspace`.
- Which scope a fixture takes, which conftest level it belongs at, builders versus fixtures →
  `test-principles`, the constitution. This skill is the flat-family artifact that implements it.
- The project has a domain layer and a dishka composition root → `hex-test-integration-setup`, in the
  `pyhouse-hex` plugin.
- The family itself is unsettled → `architecture-choice`, before either setup skill.

## Template — the shared fixtures (testcontainers, SQLAlchemy async, Alembic)

`tests/integration/conftest.py`:

```python
import os
import subprocess
import sys
from collections.abc import AsyncIterator, Iterator
from pathlib import Path

import pytest
from sqlalchemy import text
from sqlalchemy.ext.asyncio import AsyncConnection, AsyncEngine, create_async_engine

_CONTAINER_IMAGE = "postgres:17-alpine"  # the major production runs, pinned
_DISTRIBUTION_ROOT = Path(__file__).resolve().parents[2]


@pytest.fixture(scope="session")
def db_dsn() -> Iterator[str]:
    from testcontainers.community.postgres import PostgresContainer

    with PostgresContainer(_CONTAINER_IMAGE, driver="asyncpg") as pg:
        yield pg.get_connection_url()


def _alembic(dsn: str, *args: str) -> None:
    result = subprocess.run(
        [sys.executable, "-m", "alembic", *args],
        capture_output=True,
        text=True,
        cwd=_DISTRIBUTION_ROOT,
        env={**os.environ, "MYAPP_POSTGRES_DSN": dsn},
    )
    assert result.returncode == 0, result.stderr


@pytest.fixture(scope="session")
def _migrated_db(db_dsn: str) -> str:
    """Up, down to the base and up again, so every downgrade() runs once per session."""
    _alembic(db_dsn, "upgrade", "head")
    _alembic(db_dsn, "downgrade", "base")
    _alembic(db_dsn, "upgrade", "head")
    return db_dsn


@pytest.fixture(scope="session")
async def engine(_migrated_db: str) -> AsyncIterator[AsyncEngine]:
    engine = create_async_engine(_migrated_db)
    try:
        yield engine
    finally:
        await engine.dispose()


@pytest.fixture
async def conn(engine: AsyncEngine) -> AsyncIterator[AsyncConnection]:
    """For anything that accepts a connection; rolled back at teardown."""
    async with engine.connect() as connection:
        trans = await connection.begin()
        try:
            yield connection
        finally:
            await trans.rollback()


@pytest.fixture(autouse=True)
async def truncate_all(engine: AsyncEngine) -> AsyncIterator[None]:
    """For code that opens and owns its own transaction; wipes every table afterwards."""
    from myapp.postgres.metadata import metadata

    yield
    tables = ", ".join(f'"{t.name}"' for t in metadata.sorted_tables)
    if not tables:
        return
    async with engine.begin() as cleanup:
        await cleanup.execute(text(f"TRUNCATE {tables} RESTART IDENTITY CASCADE"))
```

**`db_dsn` yields only the container the suite started**, so nothing it can reach holds data anyone
else wants. Pointing the suite at a database it did not start is a mode of its own, and it arrives with
its guard (`## Other bindings`, rules 2 and 3).

The image tag is a named constant because **the container runs the major version production
runs**, pinned to it, so the suite exercises the planner and DDL surface the migrations will meet. A
floating tag moves the schema under the suite between runs.

**The migration history runs up, down to the base, and up again, once per session.** That round trip is
what proves every revision's `downgrade()` reverses its `upgrade()` (`persistence` rule 20), and the suite
then runs against the schema the history produces. The subprocess runs from the distribution root, where
`alembic.ini` sits, and hands the container's DSN to the migration environment under the variable that
environment reads — the data-access component's own, `MYAPP_POSTGRES_DSN` (`flat-project-setup`).

`truncate_all` is autouse **here** because this conftest is scoped to one directory of integration tests,
all of which reach code that commits. Autouse is also what orders it: pytest sets it up before any fixture
the test requests by name and so finalizes it last, after `conn`'s transaction has rolled back and its
connection returned to the pool — which `TRUNCATE`'s `ACCESS EXCLUSIVE` lock needs (rule 7).

The pytest configuration is `python-toolchain`'s `[tool.pytest.ini_options]` block, in the
distribution's own `pyproject.toml` — or, where several distributions share one repository, in the
root `pyproject.toml` that `python-workspace` lays, since pytest reads one configuration per run. Both
of its loop-scope lines are load-bearing here (rule 8).

No placeholder connection string is set for collection: nothing in the service builds settings or an
engine at import (`flat-persistence` rule 6), so an unset variable fails only the code that reads it.

The container library is imported **inside** the fixture that needs it, not at module scope, so a
pure-unit collection pays nothing for it.

## Other bindings

- **One shared instance of these fixtures, where several distributions in one repository share a
  datastore.** The bodies move verbatim into a pytest plugin module beside the tests of the library that
  owns the schema, registered from the repository root's configuration, so every member loads the one
  module instead of a copy each (`python-workspace` carries the root configuration and runs each
  member's suite). Three things
  change and nothing else does: every environment name follows the owning library rather than a
  dependant, the migration subprocess runs from that library's directory, and **nothing in the module is
  autouse** — a plugin is loaded for every collection in the repository, so `truncate_all` keeps its body
  but loses `autouse=True` and each member whose code commits turns it on for its own tests in a
  one-line wrapper fixture.
- **A pre-provisioned throwaway database** — a compose service, a CI service container, one issued per
  branch. `db_dsn` gains a branch behind a dedicated opt-in flag, carrying rules 2 and 3; the migration run,
  the engine scope and both isolation fixtures are unchanged.
- **An in-process or file-backed engine** (SQLite through an async driver). Cheapest to start, and it
  costs what this level buys: upsert semantics, generated constraint names and transaction behaviour are
  no longer production's, so `flat-test-persistence`'s constraint-name and conflict-path assertions stop
  meaning anything. Never for the data-access package's own suite.
- **A non-relational store**, beside a relational one or alone, gets its own session-scoped container
  and client, and isolates by a per-test namespace deleted at teardown — there is no transaction to roll
  back.
- **Creating the schema from the metadata instead of replaying the migration history.** Faster, and it
  stops testing that the migrations produce the schema the code expects — which is the drift the history
  exists to prevent. Keep the history wherever the migrations are themselves an artifact the project
  ships. **For a store the service reads but another project owns, it is the only choice**: the service
  carries no history for those tables (`persistence`, its schema-ownership row), so `_migrated_db` becomes one
  `metadata.create_all` over the tables the service declares, and the round trip of rule 1 lapses.

## Rules

1. **The migration runs from wherever the schema is defined** — this distribution, or the owning
   library when several share one — with the round trip of `persistence` rule 20; it is the project's
   own schema path `test-principles`, *Datastore contract* rule 8, requires, and a store another
   project owns is created from the metadata instead.
2. **Where the suite can reach a database it did not start, the guard of `test-principles` reliability
   rule 1 lives inside the fixture producing the connection details**, comparing the database name by
   whole-name equality against one project-declared constant. A guard fixture of its own is bypassed by
   whatever reaches for the connection details directly.
3. **Using a datastore the suite did not start is opt-in behind a dedicated flag** (`test-principles`
   reliability rules 1 and 6); raise a named error listing every missing variable.
4. **One pool per run, one transaction per test** — the scopes `test-principles` *Fixture scope rules*
   set. A session-scoped connection would serialize the suite onto one connection.
5. **Nothing under `tests/` builds its own pool or calls the production engine factory**
   (`test-principles` reliability rule 6, and its one exception). Tests take the shared fixture and pass
   it explicitly to whatever needs one.
6. **The whole-schema wipe has one body, and it runs after the test rather than before.** Cleaning up
   afterwards means a failing test leaves the datastore inspectable under a debugger, and the next test
   still starts empty. One body wherever it is defined — a second copy is two behaviours waiting to
   diverge. Shared across distributions, it loses autouse (`## Other bindings`).
7. **Do not request the wipe by name in a test that only uses the rollback connection.** The rollback
   already covers it, and a by-name request loses the autouse ordering that keeps the wipe's exclusive
   table lock from meeting the connection's still-open transaction.
8. **Every fixture and test shares the session-scoped engine's one event loop** — `test-principles`,
   *Fixture scope rules*; the two loop-scope lines of `python-toolchain`'s pytest block are that rule here.
9. **Code that opens and owns its transaction is isolated by the wipe, never by a rollback or savepoint
   fixture.** It opens its own connection (`persistence` rule 1), so a savepoint isolates a
   connection nothing under test uses, and the test passes while asserting nothing.

## Hard stops

- The distribution has no relational store → stop; none of these fixtures applies — no transaction to
  roll back, no schema to truncate.
- The code under test sits behind a domain port and a dishka container → stop, use
  `hex-test-integration-setup`, in the `pyhouse-hex` plugin.
