description: Use when deciding what version a Python distribution declares and what changes it — a first release, a breaking change, a deprecation, a pre-release, a tag, or the note a consumer reads before upgrading.

# Python Versioning — what the number promises, and what changes it

The version a distribution declares, the change that moves it, and the tag and note that make it
reachable. **The number is a claim about compatibility**, so this skill is about the claim first and
the digits second. What the compatible surface actually consists of is `python-packaging`'s; this
skill owns what happens to the number when that surface changes.

**Precondition — something chooses which version to install.** Which rules bind follows from who
reads the number, not from how the project is built:

| Does anything… | If no, these do not apply |
|---|---|
| depend on this by a version range, or install it from an index | rules 6, 7, 8, 9 — no one can be broken by a bump nobody reads |
| have a declared public surface | rules 6, 7, 8 — there is no promise for a change to break |
| publish to an index that refuses re-uploads | rule 11 — a mistake is corrected in place, not outlived |
| ship its members as separate artifacts | rule 13 — one artifact, one number |

**Rules 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 12 and 14 hold for any distribution at all**, including one deployed from a
commit and installed by nothing. A service that is built from `main` and run in a container has no
consumer choosing a version, so its number is a **label** rather than a promise — it still has to be
single-sourced, canonical and tagged, so a running artifact can be traced back to a tree, and that is
all.

**A version nobody depends on is a label, not a promise.** Leaving it at `0.1.0` while nothing
installs it by range is accurate, not neglect. What is not accurate is `0.y.z` after something started
depending on it.

## When to use vs. neighbours

- What the compatible surface consists of — what a library root re-exports, and the fact that a
  distributable package's root *is* its public API → `python-packaging`. This skill says which bump a
  change to that surface forces; it does not define the surface.
- Retiring a published identifier — a name that escaped the codebase and became an external contract
  is added alongside and retired deliberately, never renamed in place → `naming`. This skill adds that
  the retirement lands in a major, and the deprecation in a minor before it.
- An error `code` that clients and dashboards key on → `exception-catalog` owns its stability; the
  release that retires one is this skill's.
- Choosing a version floor or a pin for a dependency this project **consumes** → the inverse concern,
  and not here. A floor states a known breaking boundary in someone else's history; this skill is
  about producing your own. The hexagonal family states the consuming rule under `hex-project-setup`,
  in the `pyhouse-hex` plugin.
- A repository holding several distributions — the member split, in-repo dependency edges, tooling
  settled once → `python-workspace`. It governs members; which number each member carries is here.
- Database schema evolution and the migration chain → the family's persistence skill. A migration is
  versioned by its own chain, not by the distribution's number.
- A library, an SDK or any distributed package has no architecture family — `architecture-choice`
  names that shape as one this catalogue does not cover, and says the universal skills still bind in
  full. This is one of them, and it binds hardest there: a distributed package is the case where the
  number has readers.

## Template — static declaration, canonical PEP 440

The version is a literal in `pyproject.toml`, changed only in the commit that cuts a release — once
per release, however many changes since the last tag earned it. A commit that is not a release leaves
it alone; bumping as each change lands carries the number past anything that was released.

```toml
[project]
name = "myapp"
version = "1.4.0"
requires-python = ">=3.13"
```

Three integer components, no `v`, no hyphen, no plus sign. The pre-release ladder, when one is cut,
is exactly three phases and no others:

```
1.5.0a1  →  1.5.0b1  →  1.5.0rc1  →  1.5.0
```

The tag carries the `v` that the version field must not:

```bash
git tag -a v1.4.0 -m "myapp 1.4.0"
git push origin v1.4.0
```

Runtime access reads the installed distribution's metadata rather than a second literal, and reads it
when asked, not at import — `python-packaging` rule 8 builds nothing at import time, and a metadata
lookup is a filesystem read. The function lives in a module of its own, or where the version is
reported — never in the package root, whose contents are `python-packaging`'s:

```python
# src/myapp/version.py
from importlib.metadata import version


def get_version() -> str:
    return version("myapp")
```

That call takes the **distribution** name, which need not equal the import package's name.

## Other bindings

- **The backend reads the number from source** (`dynamic = ["version"]` plus a backend setting
  pointing at a module attribute). The declaration moves into Python and the static `version` key must
  be removed — declaring both is an error every conforming backend raises. Single-sourcing, canonical
  form, the bump rules and the tag are unchanged; what you give up is that the authoritative number is
  no longer readable without running the build.
- **The tag is the declaration** (`setuptools-scm`, `hatch-vcs`). The tag becomes the source of truth,
  so the number and the history cannot drift, and every build between tags is a development version.
  Two settings stop being optional: the local-version segment has to be suppressed for anything
  published, because an index will refuse a version carrying one, and a fallback has to be set or a
  build without repository metadata fails outright. The bump decision, the promise and the note are
  unchanged — only where the number is stored moves.
- **A date-based scheme** (`YYYY.MM.DD`, as several large Python projects use). Rules 6, 7 and 8 lapse
  entirely, because the segments no longer encode compatibility; rule 14 becomes the whole of the
  contract, and it has to be stated loudly, since a reader's default assumption is that the first
  segment means something it does not.

## Rules

1. **Say what the number is a claim about, where a consumer will look.** A version means nothing until
   the surface it refers to is declared; an undeclared surface makes every bump below unfalsifiable.
   `python-packaging` owns what that surface is for a distributable package.

2. **One declaration is the source of truth.** Where the number necessarily appears twice — a
   packaging declaration and a module attribute — one derives from the other, or a test asserts they
   are equal. Two hand-maintained copies drift, and the stale one is the one a reader trusts.

3. **A published version string is already in its canonical form.** Do not rely on a normalizer you
   cannot see run: a non-canonical string is either rewritten silently into something else or rejected
   outright, and which of the two you get depends on the string. The rewrite is the dangerous case,
   because nothing is reported.

4. **Three integer components, always.** A two-component number compares equal to its three-component
   form but produces a different artifact filename, so both can exist and no resolver can tell them
   apart. Nothing in the toolchain enforces the arity; this rule is the enforcement.

5. **The `v` belongs on the tag and nowhere else.** In a version field it is ignored and stripped, so
   it is a character that survives review and not the build.

6. **A change that can break a consumer who used only the declared surface is a major** — from
   `1.0.0` on; below it, rule 9 says what it bumps. That includes removing or renaming a name in it,
   changing what a call returns, reordering or retyping its parameters, changing a default that a call
   omitting it depends on, and changing which exception a documented failure raises. Whether the consumer *deserved* to depend on it is not the test; whether
   the surface declared it is.

7. **Adding to the surface without changing what is there is a minor, and so is deprecating.** A
   deprecation is a release event of its own: it ships in a minor, at least one release before the
   removal it announces, so a consumer has a version they can move to before the one that breaks them.

8. **A fix that changes no declared behaviour is a patch.** A fix that changes declared behaviour is
   not a patch however small the diff, and a security fix that must break the surface is the deliberate
   exception — take it, and say so in the note rather than pretending the bump was compatible.

9. **`0.y.z` withholds the promise, deliberately, so below `1.0.0` a break bumps the minor.** Anything
   may change at any time there, and that is a legitimate state to ship in while nothing depends on
   you. It stops being legitimate the moment something does. A break moves `0.4.2` to `0.5.0`, as an
   addition does, and a fix moves the patch; no break carries the number to `1.0.0`. Reaching `1.0.0`
   is the act of making the promise — a decision for whoever makes it, never the consequence of one
   breaking change, and not a milestone earned by maturity.

10. **A released version is immutable.** A correction is the next number. Where an index refuses to let
    a filename be reused even after deletion, this stops being a convention and becomes the only
    available behaviour — the number is spent whether or not the artifact was right.

11. **Withdraw a bad release rather than replacing it.** The mechanism that marks a release as one
    installers should skip exists for this; deleting it instead breaks every consumer who pinned it
    and frees nothing, because the name cannot be reused.

12. **A pre-release is one of the three phases, and it is invisible by default.** Alpha, beta and
    release candidate are the only pre-release kinds a Python version can express. Ordinary installs
    exclude them unless asked, so publishing one and seeing no uptake is the mechanism working.

13. **Members of one repository version independently.** Lockstep is correct only where a single
    artifact ships them all. A shared library several distributions depend on carries its own number,
    and bumping it is a release its consumers choose to take — which is the whole reason it has one.

14. **State where the scheme deviates, loudly.** Strict compatibility-encoding is not the Python norm,
    and a project that bends it — a minor that may carry a narrow break, a date-based scheme, a `0.y.z`
    kept deliberately — owes its consumers that sentence where they will read it before upgrading, not
    in a commit message.

## Hard stops

- A version is being bumped because time passed, or because the release feels substantial → stop, the
  segment states what changed to the declared surface, not how much work it was.
- A breaking change is being shipped as a minor because a major looks alarming → stop, the major is
  the signal; suppressing it moves the breakage to a consumer who had no reason to test for it. Below
  `1.0.0` the minor is the right number (rule 9), and this stop does not apply.
- A hyphen or a plus sign is being written into a version field → stop, that is not this ecosystem's
  spelling; a plus sign in particular marks a locally patched rebuild, changes ordering, and is
  refused by public indexes.
- A commit hash, build number or branch name is being stamped into the version to identify a build →
  stop, that is the tag's job and the artifact's metadata's job.
- A post-release is being used to ship a bug fix → stop, it sorts after the release it names and is
  meant for correcting a release's notes; ship a patch.
- A published version is being re-uploaded with corrected contents → stop, publish the next number.
- A tag is being moved to a different commit → stop, a tag names a release and a release is immutable;
  cut the next one.
- `0.y.z` is being kept while consumers are being told the surface is stable → stop, either make the
  promise or withdraw the claim; both are honest and the combination is not.
- A release note is being generated from the commit log → stop, a consumer reads it to decide whether
  to upgrade, and a commit log does not answer that question.
- A deprecation and the removal it announces are landing in the same release → stop, the deprecation
  ships first, in its own release.
- Asked which version of a dependency this project should require → stop, that is the inverse concern;
  a floor states a known breaking boundary in someone else's history.
- Asked what a package root may re-export, or what belongs to the public surface → stop, use
  `python-packaging`.
- Asked to rename a published identifier in place → stop, use `naming`; this skill covers the release
  that retires it, not the rename.
- Asked how several distributions share one repository root → stop, use `python-workspace`.
