description: Use when choosing a type annotation, deciding what shape a record takes as it crosses a boundary, or asking whether a comment belongs here. Owns the 3.13 house interpreter floor for a new deployable project, whose floor for a distributed package is its consumers', `X | None` over `Optional`, the ban on `from __future__ import annotations`, immutable collection types, when a type error may be silenced inline, the rule that a fixed-shape record is a declared type rather than a bare `dict` or tuple, which builtin represents an exact decimal quantity, an instant and an identifier, and a closed set of constants as an `Enum`. What to log and which scope logs it is `python-logging`; whether a constrained scalar also earns a named type of its own belongs to the architecture family; the error classes themselves are `exception-catalog`.

# Python Style

Project-wide rules that are stricter than CPython's defaults and hold **whatever the architecture is** —
a hexagonal app, a flat-layered worker, or a standalone script. Two subjects: what the types look like,
and where a comment is warranted.

## When to use vs. neighbours

- Writing or changing any annotation, or any comment → this skill.
- Any log call, event name or logging configuration → `python-logging`.
- One class per module, `__all__`, the `__init__.py` re-export contract, import forms →
  `python-packaging`.
- Deriving a concrete class or module name → `naming`; deriving a concrete artifact *path* in a
  hexagonal project → `hex-conventions`, in the `pyhouse-hex` plugin.
- The exception classes themselves → `exception-catalog`.
- Where a module lives and what may import it → `hex-architecture` (in the `pyhouse-hex` plugin) or
  `flat-layered` (in `pyhouse-flat`), whichever style the project uses.
- The shape of a specific artifact → its own skill. This skill is consulted **alongside** them.

## Typing

### `X | None`, not `Optional[X]`

```python
# yes
name: str | None = None


def find(id: UUID) -> Foo | None: ...


# no
from typing import Optional

name: Optional[str] = None
```

PEP 604 union syntax is the default. `Union[A, B]` is equally banned — write `A | B`. This holds
everywhere, validation models included.

### Never `from __future__ import annotations`

Do not add this import to any module. Projects in this style rely on **runtime annotation
introspection** — the validation library, dependency-injection providers, dataclass `__post_init__`
checks, ORM/Core column inference. Stringified annotations break those tools silently, and the failure
shows up as a mis-parsed field rather than an error. Modern runtimes give PEP 604 syntax without it.

If a third-party tool tells you to add it, the fix is to change the annotation, not to silence the
runtime.

**A self-referential annotation is written as a string literal.** A class that annotates with its own
name — `def satisfies(self, required: "Foo") -> bool` inside `class Foo`, a factory classmethod annotated
`-> "Foo"`, a node whose field is `parent: "Foo | None"` — quotes that one annotation. The name is not
bound until the class statement finishes, so an unquoted reference raises `NameError` at
class-definition time, and the future import that would have deferred it is banned above. Quote only the
self-reference; every other annotation stays bare, so runtime introspection keeps working everywhere it
matters.

### The interpreter floor

**The house floor is Python 3.13.** It is a choice this style makes, not a requirement the templates
impose: one floor across every new project means every reader meets one set of forms. The catalogue's
templates are written against it and use the newer forms freely — `enum.StrEnum`, `datetime.UTC`,
PEP 695 `type` aliases and generic syntax, `AsyncGenerator[None]` with its defaulted send type — but
none of them needs 3.13 itself; they type-check and lint clean against 3.12 as well.

**The house floor applies to a new project. An existing project below it is not a violation.** It keeps
the floor it has, and the catalogue's rules apply to it unchanged. The templates type-check and lint
from 3.12 up; a project below 3.12 adapts the few newer forms they use — PEP 695 `type` aliases and
generic syntax (`def f[T](…)`) become `TypeAlias` and `TypeVar`, and below 3.11 `enum.StrEnum` and
`datetime.UTC` become their older spellings — and keeps everything else as written. **A floor is raised
deliberately, never lowered.** Raising it is a decision — reaching the house floor, a library whose own
minimum sits higher, or a form the project wants from a newer interpreter — taken once, for the whole
project, as its own change, never in half the code.

**The house floor binds what the project deploys; a distributed package's floor is its consumers'.** A
service or a CLI tool runs on an interpreter the project chooses, so it takes the house floor. A library
or SDK others install runs on whatever interpreter each consumer has, so its floor is the oldest one its
consumers run — which may sit below the house floor — and it writes the few newer forms above in their
older spellings. Everything else here applies to it unchanged.

**The floor is chosen once, at setup, and written down in three settings that must stay in step:**
`requires-python` in the root `pyproject.toml` (`>=3.13`), the linter's `target-version` (`py313`), and
the type checker's `python_version` (`3.13`). All three name the **oldest** interpreter the project must
run on, never the newest one on the developer's machine — a form the linter permits because
`target-version` drifted upward is a form that fails on the deployment runtime. A member of a workspace
never restates them; the root settles them and every member inherits.

### Full coverage on every signature

Every function, method and `__init__` parameter is fully annotated, return type included. `-> None` is
required on a procedure. Lambdas inside business logic are forbidden — use a named function; a lambda in
`dataclasses.field(default_factory=...)` is fine because it carries no annotations.

This includes test code: a fixture annotates what it yields (`-> AsyncIterator[T]`), a builder annotates
its return, a parametrize hook types its argument. Type-checking `tests` at parity with `src` is only
possible because of this.

### Type suppressions

A type error is fixed, not silenced: restate the type, narrow with a runtime guard, or `cast` after a
guard the checker cannot follow. **An inline type-ignore is the last resort, where the checker is wrong
and the code cannot be restated to satisfy it** — in source and tests alike, it names the one error code
it silences and carries the reason on the same line (`# type: ignore[<code>]  # <why>`), so it stops
hiding the next error in that expression. A package that ships no type information is never silenced
inline: it gets one per-package override in the type checker's configuration (`python-toolchain`).

### `Any` only at raw external boundaries

`typing.Any` is permitted only where data has not yet been parsed:

- raw deserialized JSON before validation;
- a third-party SDK return type not yet narrowed.

Related convention: when collecting heterogeneous values, use `dict[str, object]`, not `dict[str, Any]`
— as in `context: dict[str, object]` on an exception — because `object` forces explicit narrowing at the
point of consumption.

Past the boundary — in business logic, a handler body, a run function — `Any` is forbidden. If a type is
hard to express, introduce a `type` alias or a small dataclass.

### A `type` alias for repeated complex types

```python
from uuid import UUID

type FooKey = tuple[UUID, int]
```

The PEP 695 `type` statement, not `typing.TypeAlias` — the statement is the form the house floor gives,
and it is evaluated lazily, so an alias may name a class defined further down. Use one whenever the same composite — a `tuple[…, …]`, a `dict[str, frozenset[UUID]]`, a callable
signature — appears in more than one signature. Place it at the top of the module owning the concept,
after imports and before classes, and re-export it via `__all__` if it crosses module boundaries. For a
module-internal one-shot type, write the type out; a premature alias hides intent.

### Immutable collections on shared value types

A type that is frozen, hashed, compared, or passed across a boundary uses **immutable** collections, so
it cannot be mutated by a holder that was only meant to read it.

| Mutable | Immutable equivalent |
|---|---|
| `list[T]` | `tuple[T, ...]` when ordered, `Sequence[T]` for a read-only view |
| `set[T]` | `frozenset[T]` |
| `dict[K, V]` | `Mapping[K, V]` for a read-only view, a frozen dataclass for a fixed-shape record |

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Foo:
    id: UUID
    tags: frozenset[str]
    items: tuple[Item, ...]
```

Conversion happens at the boundary: the caller converts — `tags=frozenset(payload.tags)`,
`items=tuple(item_inputs)`. A wire schema may hold `list[...]`, the validation library's natural shape;
the frozen type stores the frozen form.

Ordinary procedural code may use mutable collections **internally** — loop accumulators, row building —
but anything crossing into a frozen type is converted first.

### A record that crosses a boundary is a declared type

A value that leaves the scope that built it — returned from a client, handed to a run function, passed
between packages, stored on another object — arrives somewhere that has to know its shape. A bare
`dict`, a bare tuple or a forwarded `**kwargs` does not carry that shape: the receiving side learns the
keys by reading the sender, the checker verifies nothing, and a renamed key fails at the line that
reads it rather than at the line that changed it.

**Anything with a fixed set of named fields is declared once, as a type, and passed as that type.**
The declaration is a frozen dataclass in the ordinary case — the form the table above already names for
a fixed-shape record — or the validation library's model where the same boundary is also where the data
is parsed.

| Being passed | Declare instead |
|---|---|
| a `dict` whose keys are known when the code is written | a frozen dataclass, or a validation model at a parse boundary |
| a tuple whose positions mean different things | a frozen dataclass; a `type` alias only when it is genuinely n of one thing |
| `**kwargs` forwarded and unpacked further down | named parameters, or one parameter of a declared type |

A `dict` is still the right type where the **keys are data**: a lookup keyed by id, a count per
category, a payload whose keys are not known until runtime. The rule is about a *record* — a fixed set
of named fields — not about every mapping. `dict[str, object]` for heterogeneous values, above, is that
case and is unaffected.

`TypedDict` declares the keys but leaves the object a `dict`: nothing is checked at construction, and
there is no type to hang an invariant or a method on. Use it only where a mapping's shape must be
described without changing the object — a third-party call that requires a literal `dict` — never as
the default record form. `NamedTuple` has no use here at all; a frozen dataclass gives the same
immutability without the positional half nobody wanted.

Conversion happens at the boundary, the same way the collection conversions above do: the raw form is
parsed or constructed into the declared type at the edge, and the declared type is what travels inward.

### Which builtin represents which kind of value

A scalar whose kind constrains its representation takes the type that carries the constraint, not the
one that is shortest to write:

- **An exact decimal quantity is `decimal.Decimal`** — money, a rate, anything summed, compared for
  equality, or shown to someone who will check the arithmetic. A binary float cannot represent most
  decimal fractions exactly, so the same total added in a different order is a different number and an
  equality check on it is a coin toss. A genuine measurement, carrying no exactness claim, stays a
  `float`.
- **An instant is a timezone-aware `datetime`.** A naive one carries no offset, so two of them cannot
  be compared or subtracted correctly once anything runs in a second zone, and every store it passes
  through is free to reinterpret it. A calendar day with no instant in it stays a `date`.
- **An identifier this project mints is `uuid.UUID`, not `str`.** The string form belongs at the edges
  — a log field, a path parameter, a wire model — and the conversion happens there. Inside, a swapped
  identifier is then a type error rather than a lookup that quietly returns nothing. **An identifier
  issued elsewhere** — a webhook's event id, a broker's message id, an identity provider's subject, a
  store's own sequence included — keeps its issuer's form, since nothing promises it parses as a UUID,
  and is a distinct type over that form (a `NewType` over `str` or `int`, say), never the bare builtin.

These are representation rules: they say which builtin holds the value. **Whether a constrained scalar
also earns a named type of its own** — an amount that must be non-negative, a code that must match a
pattern — is an architecture question this skill does not answer. The hexagonal family answers it with
a value object whose invariant is checked at construction (`hex-domain-model`, in the `pyhouse-hex`
plugin); a service with no domain layer checks it where the value enters and keeps the scalar.

### A closed set of named constants is an enum

A fixed set of named values — a status, a kind, a mode — is an `enum.Enum`, and a `StrEnum` when its
values are strings (`class Foo(str, Enum)` below 3.11). **Never a class of bare attributes** (`class Status: ACTIVE = "active"`): nothing
stops a value outside the set, the checker cannot tell a status from any other string, and there is no
iteration over the members. This holds in every module, whatever layer it sits in.

### Protocols

- `typing.Protocol` for an interface, where the architecture calls for one at all. (A flat-layered
  service introduces one only when a second real implementation exists; the hexagonal family defines
  ports by default. Each family's own rule is in `flat-layered`, in the `pyhouse-flat` plugin, and
  `hex-domain-ports`, in `pyhouse-hex`.)
- `@runtime_checkable` **only** when `isinstance(x, IProtocol)` is genuinely needed, and never in a hot
  path: it walks the protocol's attributes on every call.
- A protocol's method signatures carry full annotations like any other function. The `...` is the
  **method body**, never a parameter default.

### Validation models

- Model field types use the same `X | None` and PEP 585 generic forms — `list[int]`, `dict[str, str]`,
  not `List[int]` / `Dict[str, str]`. The forms above hold here with no exemption.
- **A constraint is declared on the field it bounds, in the annotation**, so the accepted shape reads
  top to bottom in one pass and a generated schema can be derived from it. Not an imperative validator
  method, and not a default-carrying assignment standing in for a constraint on a field that has no
  default — a field is optional because it has a default, never because declaring the bound was
  awkward. Under the validation library this catalogue's templates bind, that is
  `Annotated[int, Field(ge=1)]` rather than `field: int = Field(default=…)`; under another, it is
  whatever that library declares beside the field.

### Collections from `collections.abc`

| Use | Not |
|---|---|
| `collections.abc.Sequence` | `typing.Sequence` |
| `collections.abc.Mapping` | `typing.Mapping` |
| `collections.abc.Iterable` | `typing.Iterable` |
| `collections.abc.AsyncIterator` | `typing.AsyncIterator` |
| `collections.abc.Callable` | `typing.Callable` |

The `typing.*` aliases have long been deprecated; `collections.abc` keeps imports consistent and avoids a
needless `typing` import.

## Comments

Default to **no comments**. Where one is warranted it is a single short line of non-obvious *why* —
never *what*, never a multi-line block. The scope of that rule is not uniform across the tree:

- **In source**: the rule as stated, unconditionally.
- **In migrations**: the same form. A revision module's docstring is not a comment, and this rule does
  not reach it.
- **In tests**: the same holds inside a test body. Additionally legal is a **multi-line section banner**
  above a group of tests, when it says *what* the group pins and *why* it is pinned that way — which
  behaviour the group stands as evidence for, that the clock is the real one and not a substituted
  double, that both routes have to be exercised. A banner that retells what the tests below it do →
  stop; that is the code said twice, and it is the form that goes stale. *This allowance rests on banners
  having held so far, not on a test of failure, so it carries its withdrawal condition: if a banner is
  ever found lying or silently out of date, the allowance goes and tests fall under the source form.*

Structural labels are not comments worth writing: no `# Arrange` / `# Act` / `# Assert`, no `# imports`,
no `# helpers`.

## Rules

1. Apply the union, generic and runtime-annotation forms in **Typing**, including validation models.
2. Check complete signature coverage in source and tests; use named functions for business logic.
3. **Settle the interpreter floor once, at setup — for a new project at the house floor of 3.13 or
   above** — and keep `requires-python`, the linter's `target-version` and the type checker's
   `python_version` naming that same oldest supported interpreter. An existing project below the house
   floor keeps its floor; a floor is raised deliberately, never lowered. The house floor binds a
   deployable; a distributed package's floor is the oldest interpreter its consumers run.
4. Restrict `Any` to the two raw-boundary cases; use the documented heterogeneous-value and repeated-type
   forms after parsing.
5. Check shared value types against the immutable-collection table and convert at their boundary.
6. **A record crossing a boundary is a declared type, not a bare `dict`, tuple or forwarded
   `**kwargs`.** A fixed set of named fields is declared once and passed as that type; a mapping whose
   keys are data stays a mapping. `TypedDict` describes a shape without creating a type and is for the
   case that must stay a `dict`; `NamedTuple` is not used.
7. **A scalar takes the builtin that carries its kind** — an exact decimal quantity, an instant with an
   offset, an identifier this project mints as a `UUID` and one issued elsewhere as a distinct type over
   its issuer's form — and converts to a string form only at the edge that needs one. Whether it also earns a named type of its own is the architecture family's question, not this
   skill's.
8. Apply **Protocols** only where the architecture calls for an interface; reserve runtime checking for
   the documented need.
9. Check validation constraints and abstract collection imports against their dedicated typing sections.
10. Apply **Comments** by location, preserving its revision-docstring and test-banner allowances and
    their stated limits.
11. **A type error is fixed, not silenced; an inline type-ignore is the last resort, names its error
    code and gives its reason**, and a missing stub is silenced only by a per-package configuration
    override. Check casts and untyped variadic arguments against the typing hard stops below.
12. **A closed set of named constants is an `Enum` — a `StrEnum` for string values (`class Foo(str, Enum)` below 3.11) — never a class of bare
    attributes**, in any module.

## Hard stops

Typing:

- `from __future__ import annotations` anywhere → stop, runtime annotation introspection breaks silently
  with stringified annotations.
- A class annotating with its own bare name inside its own body → stop, quote that one annotation
  (`required: "Foo"`); unquoted it is a `NameError` at class-definition time, and the future import that
  would defer it is banned.
- `Optional[X]` or `Union[A, B]` → stop, use `X | None` / `A | B`.
- `requires-python`, `target-version` and `python_version` naming different interpreters → stop, make
  all three name the project's oldest supported one; three disagreeing settings let a form pass the
  linter that fails at runtime.
- A floor being lowered, or a new deployable being laid down below 3.13 → stop, keep the floor where it
  is or start at the house floor. An existing project already below it is not a violation; it raises its
  floor as its own change when it decides to. A distributed package whose consumers run an older
  interpreter is not this case; its floor is theirs.
- Bare `Any` outside the documented external-boundary cases → stop, introduce a `type` alias or a small
  dataclass; do not let `Any` spread.
- Untyped `**kwargs` / `*args` in business logic → stop, a dataclass is missing.
- A `dict` or tuple with a fixed set of known fields crossing a boundary — returned from a client,
  passed between packages, handed to a function that unpacks it → stop, declare the record as a type.
  A mapping whose keys are data is not this case.
- `float` for money or any other exact decimal quantity, or a naive `datetime` for an instant → stop,
  `Decimal` and an aware `datetime`; the first disagrees with itself under reordering, the second under
  a second timezone.
- An unannotated fixture, builder or test helper → stop, the test surface is type-checked at parity with
  source.
- `cast(...)` to silence a type error → stop, fix the type. `cast` is acceptable only to narrow after a
  runtime guard the checker cannot follow, which is rare.
- A type-ignore comment that names no error code or gives no reason → stop, name the specific code and
  give a brief explanation — or, first, restate the type so none is needed.
- A missing-stub error silenced inline → stop, one per-package override in the type checker's
  configuration (`python-toolchain`).
- A mutable collection on a frozen dataclass field → stop, use the immutable equivalent.
- A class of bare attributes standing in for a closed set of values (`class Status: ACTIVE = "active"`)
  → stop, declare an `Enum` or `StrEnum`.

Comments:

- A comment that is not a non-obvious *why*, or one running past a single short line → stop.
- A structural label (`# Arrange`, `# helpers`) → stop, delete it.
- A test banner that retells what the tests do rather than what they pin → stop.
