name: hex-test-app-invariants
description: Use when testing a property of the assembled HTTP app itself rather than one route's own behaviour — a check that needs no edit when an endpoint is added or removed — or the construct smoke any entrypoint gets. Covers the catalogue's error shape on every error code the published OpenAPI document advertises, the CORS preflight and the request-size limit where the app configures them, and the app-construction smoke, each built with `create_app()` and taking its inputs from the app rather than from a maintained list; a service with no HTTP entrypoint keeps only the smoke, for its own entrypoint. A single endpoint's test is `hex-test-restapi-endpoint`; the anonymous-caller probe and every token fixture are `hex-test-restapi-auth`'s.

# Hex Test — App Invariants

Consult `test-principles` for the testing constitution. Where this skill contradicts `test-principles`, the constitution wins.

One-shot per project with an HTTP entrypoint. Up to four files under `tests/unit/restapi/`, each of which builds the app with `create_app()` and asserts a single global property; none of them needs to be edited when an endpoint is added or removed. None needs a store, so none waits on the integration suite's containers. An app that declares auth gains one more discovered invariant — every protected route rejects an anonymous caller — which is `hex-test-restapi-auth`'s.

## When to use vs. neighbours

- Laying the cross-cutting tests for the first time → this skill.
- A per-endpoint integration test → `hex-test-restapi-endpoint`.
- The integration fixtures, `real_app` among them → `hex-test-integration-setup`; nothing here takes them.
- The every-protected-route-rejects-an-anonymous-caller probe, and the fixtures that mint tokens → `hex-test-restapi-auth` (auth apps only; nothing here consumes them — see Rule 8).
- The route-side `error_responses(...)` declaration that puts the catalogue's shape on each advertised code → `hex-restapi-endpoint`, in its sibling `CONTRACTS.md`; the 401/403 half of it → `hex-restapi-auth`.
- A grep-firewall static rule → `test-architecture-rule` (compile-time, not runtime).
- The testing constitution — markers, async mode, the mocking prohibition → `test-principles`.

A health or info endpoint is tested like any endpoint (`hex-test-restapi-endpoint`).

## Other bindings

- **Another web framework.** Every rule here survives the swap; reading the CORS origin and the size
  cap off the running app rather than freezing them stays the rule, and only the attribute they are read
  from is the framework's.
- **A framework that generates no API document.** The error-shape check then has nothing to walk and
  that file is not written. The construct smoke still is, and the CORS preflight and the size-limit
  probe where the app configures them.

## Rules

Consult `test-principles` for the testing constitution.

1. **Every test discovers its inputs from the app itself** — never from a hand-maintained route or expectation table, and never from a value frozen into the test. The operations come off the app's published document; the CORS origin is read off the app's CORS configuration, never the source app's dev origin, and `allow_credentials` is not assumed; the size cap, and the operation the probe posts to, are read off the app's own middleware and document, the probe sending one byte past the cap. A probe file exists only where its feature is configured (rule 9), so the feature being absent from the app is a failure, as an empty walk is (rule 3). The cost of adding a new endpoint must be zero in this directory.
2. **Walk the operations the app publishes, under the path its document is keyed on**, never a key assembled by hand out of a router prefix and a decorator argument — under FastAPI, the paths of `create_app().openapi()`.
3. **One reported case per discovered operation, and a walk that discovers nothing is a failure, not a pass** → `test-principles`, *When to parametrize*. An app whose routers are never wired lands there, and the non-empty assertion is the only thing between that and a green run.
4. **Every published error response carries the app's own error schema.** An advertised code whose body is the framework's own — FastAPI's validation model on a `422` the route never declared, where the app's validation handler answers with the catalogue's shape (`hex-restapi-app`) — fails.
5. **Each file holds one invariant.** Don't merge `test_cors.py` and `test_request_size_limit.py` even though both are tiny — failures in one don't mask the other, and the file names list the invariants.
6. **CORS test uses an OPTIONS preflight.** Asserting on a GET response's `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` is a softer test; the preflight is the one browsers actually consult.
7. **Request-size test uses raw bytes**, not JSON-encoded data, to bypass schema validation and hit the middleware directly. Otherwise the response is `422` (validation) before the middleware sees the body.
8. **No authenticated client here.** Every test in this skill reads the published document or probes an unauthenticated path. A test here that needs a token is either the auth probe (`hex-test-restapi-auth`) or a per-endpoint concern (`hex-test-restapi-endpoint`).
9. **Emit only the files the app's features justify.** `test_app_constructs.py` and `test_openapi_advertises_error_codes.py` are always produced; `test_cors.py` only where the app configures CORS; and `test_request_size_limit.py` only with a size-cap middleware — a CORS policy and a size cap are deployment choices (`hex-restapi-app`), not defaults every app has. A file whose module-level imports name something the app does not have fails at collection time and takes down the whole `tests/unit/restapi/` package — which is also why the auth probe is `hex-test-restapi-auth`'s and is emitted only by an app that declares auth.
10. **`test_app_constructs.py` is the always-emitted construct smoke of every HTTP app.** It builds the app with `create_app()` and forces the whole document with `app.openapi()` — sync, no fixtures, no `await`: `create_app` builds the composition root but resolves nothing, so it opens nothing, and a test needing a fixture would no longer run with no Docker daemon, the environment where the other gates pass and a construct-time dependency gap (`python-multipart`, …) slips through. It is structural (green on freshly laid routes), so every app gets it, auth or not. A service with no HTTP entrypoint keeps the obligation — a unit-level test that builds the composition root and its entrypoint object with no store — and none of the other files.

## Inlined typing / import rules

- `pytest`, `fastapi`, `httpx`, `myapp.restapi.main`.
- Full annotations on every helper.
- No `from __future__ import annotations`.

## Hard stops

- Asked to fold a per-endpoint test into one of these files → stop, these files hold discovered global properties only; a single endpoint's behaviour belongs to `hex-test-restapi-endpoint`.
- Asked for an authentication probe here → stop, use `hex-test-restapi-auth`; it owns that invariant and is emitted only by an app that declares auth.
