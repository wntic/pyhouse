name: hex-test-restapi-auth
description: Use when testing a token verifier, or any other part of a REST service that authenticates its callers — the token-verifier adapter's unit test, the signing-key and token-minting fixtures, the `authed_client` factory, the DI override that makes minted tokens verify, the discovered probe that every operation not declared public refuses an anonymous or untrusted caller, and — where the app has them — the role and cross-tenant assertions on an endpoint. Not an endpoint's non-auth half — its success body and advertised error codes (`hex-test-restapi-endpoint`) — and not another capability adapter's test (`hex-test-capability-adapter`).
when_to_use: Adding the auth fixtures to an integration suite, writing a 401 or 403 endpoint test, minting a JWT inside a test, or asserting that a protected route rejects an anonymous caller.

# Hex Test — REST API Auth

Consult `test-principles` for the testing constitution. Where this skill contradicts `test-principles`,
the constitution wins.

Every test the auth machinery needs — the verifier's own unit test and the auth half of the integration
suite — and all of it exists **only for an app that declares auth**
(`hex-restapi-auth`). An auth-less app produces none of these files: no verifier to test, no
`tests/helpers/jwt.py`, no auth fixtures in `tests/integration/api/conftest.py`, no
`test_unauth_returns_401.py`, and every endpoint test drives a plain ASGI client.

## When to use vs. neighbours

- Any other capability adapter's test — containerized, HTTP-gateway with `respx`, or another pure-CPU one → `hex-test-capability-adapter`, which owns the three flavors; the verifier test in `UNIT.md` is its pure-CPU flavor bound to auth.
- The containers, the engine, the rollback `sf`, `container` and `real_app` itself →
  `hex-test-integration-setup` (one-shot; both are defined there and every integration file here consumes
  `real_app`).
- A per-endpoint test's non-auth half — success body, advertised error codes, per-resource fixtures →
  `hex-test-restapi-endpoint`.
- The other discovered invariants — OpenAPI error codes, CORS, request-size limit, the construct smoke →
  `hex-test-app-invariants`.
- The route-side dependencies, the verifier and the code sets under test → `hex-restapi-auth`.
- A handler-level authorization rule, tested without HTTP → `hex-test-application-handler`.
- The `Role` enum's own unit test → `hex-test-domain`.
- The testing constitution these rules defer to — fixture placement, the mocking prohibition, speed targets → `test-principles`.

```

Two topic files carry the worked binding — **PyJWT, `cryptography`, httpx over ASGI, FastAPI and
pytest** — on either side of the unit/integration seam. **Read the one for the half you are writing
before writing it** — only this file is loaded automatically:

- **`UNIT.md`** — the verifier adapter's own test: module-scope keypair, real signatures, one case per
  check the verifier makes.
- **`INTEGRATION.md`** — the signer helper, the api conftest and its authenticated client, the DI
  substitution that makes a minted token verify against the real app, the discovered probe, and the
  authenticated endpoint forms.

## Other bindings

- **Opaque token plus an introspection endpoint** (`hex-restapi-auth`, *Other bindings*). What changes:
  the verifier does IO, so rule 1 names the HTTP-gateway flavour of `hex-test-capability-adapter` in
  place of the pure-CPU one; there is no keypair and no signer, so the session-scoped fixture becomes a stub
  introspection server and the "mint a fresh token per call" rule becomes "register a fresh token with
  the stub per call". Rule 10's no-mocking line moves down a level — the verifier still runs for real;
  the *upstream* is the seam the test controls.
- **Gateway- or mTLS-authenticated** (no verifier in the app). The verifier unit test and `UNIT.md`
  disappear entirely; the authenticated client sets the trusted header instead of a bearer credential,
  and the probe asserts that a request arriving *without* it is rejected. That proves the header is
  required, not that only the gateway can send it; unreachability except through the gateway is the
  deployment's (`hex-restapi-auth`).
- **`dependency-injector` as the wiring mechanism.** Only the substitution in the api conftest changes,
  the way `hex-test-integration-setup`'s bullet describes; the fixtures, the probe and every assertion
  are untouched.

## Rules

Consult `test-principles` for the testing constitution.

### The verifier's unit test

1. **The verifier's unit test is `hex-test-capability-adapter`'s pure-CPU flavour** (its rules 2–3 and
   20–22) — real keys and real signatures, settings and keys at module scope, no fixtures, and the file
   under `tests/unit/infrastructure/<adapter>/`.
2. **One test per check the verifier makes** — the signature, each claim it validates or requires, and
   any guard it raises itself — each asserting the `context` value that case sets. Counting `raise`
   statements undercounts: a catch-all branch covering issuer, audience and signature is one raise site
   and three cases.
3. **One signer for the whole suite.** The unit test and the integration fixtures mint tokens through
   the same helper, so a change to the claim shape cannot leave them disagreeing.

### The authenticated client

4. **One sanctioned authenticated client, and every test goes through it.** Building a client against
   the real app and attaching a credential header by hand is forbidden in any test file — a hand-rolled
   header is how the claim shape drifts between tests. A client without the fixture's credential is
   allowed only in the probe file — anonymous, or carrying the untrusted credential of rule 15 — and on a
   route with no auth dependency (`hex-test-restapi-endpoint`'s plain client). The client factory lives
   in `tests/integration/api/conftest.py`, never the root `tests/conftest.py`: a root-level app fixture
   makes every unit test pay the infrastructure import chain (`hex-test-integration-setup`).
5. **The client factory is entered as a context manager, never assigned** (`hex-test-restapi-endpoint`
   rule 6).
6. **Each call mints a fresh token — never cached: a reused token is how a test passes on the previous
   test's credential.** Tokens are not reused across tests, calls, or roles; a test that needs two roles
   in one body calls `authed_client(...)` twice.
7. **Mint only what the identity type declares; pass everything else via `extra_claims`.** The factory
   bakes in the subject, and the rank where the app has one, and nothing more (`hex-restapi-auth`).
   Anything further this app's identity carries (a tenant id, a display name, …) is the caller's to
   pass via `extra_claims`, pinned only when a test must share it with a fixture row (don't reuse such
   a value across unrelated tests). Never hardcode one app's identity
   model into the factory, and never name a claim key outside the binding files.
8. **The keypair and the verifier settings are session-scoped, the client factory function-scoped**
   (`test-principles`, *Fixture scope rules*): generating an RSA key is the one expensive step here.
9. **The credential the fixture mints is produced the way production's is verified**, off the same
   settings object the fixture built — same algorithm, same issuer, same audience. Substituting a
   cheaper algorithm "for speed" tests a path production does not run, and it is the substitution that
   hides an algorithm-confusion bug rather than catching it.
10. **No mocking of verification.** The verifier in `real_app` validates the token end-to-end against the
    public key these fixtures provided — that *is* the integration contract under test.
11. **`sign_token(...)` is a plain function under `tests/helpers/`** (`test-principles`, *Fixture vs.
    builder*): a test that needs an edge-case token — expired, wrong issuer — imports it directly, and no
    fixture wraps it.

### The discovered probe

12. **Protected is the default; public is declared.** Probe every operation the app serves — walked as
    `hex-test-app-invariants` rule 2 walks them, and requested under the path a client must use — except
    those the app declares public: a named set of operations in the probe file, or a marker the public
    route itself carries. Never classify by whether the auth dependency is present: a route that forgot
    it looks exactly like a public one, and that classification drops it from the probe instead of
    failing it (`hex-restapi-auth` rule 9). Every input comes off the app and the declaration, so a new
    protected endpoint joins the probe with nothing to edit.
13. **The probe substitutes path placeholders with valid-shaped dummies, by pattern and never by a
    name list.** A test for `GET /foos/{id}` with literal `{id}` in the URL hits the router as 404
    instead of triggering auth. UUID-shaped placeholders (`00000000-...`) route correctly and the
    request reaches the auth dependency. Substitute **every** `{...}` segment with one regex: an
    enumerated tuple of parameter names silently stops covering the route that introduces a new one,
    and the probe then passes by not reaching the dependency at all — the exact failure this test
    exists to catch.
14. **An empty discovery is a failure, not a skip** (`hex-test-app-invariants` rule 3). The companion
    net test asserts the walk found operations, and that every operation declared public is still one
    the app serves, so the declaration cannot drift from the routes.
15. **Every probed operation also refuses a credential the app does not trust.** The anonymous probe
    never reaches verification — the dependency refuses a missing credential first — and the verifier's
    unit test never reaches a route, so without this case a dependency that checks presence and never
    verifies passes the whole suite. Mint one with `sign_token(...)` under a key the app did not issue,
    send it to each probed operation from the probe file, and assert the 401 and its code. Per-check
    cases stay in the verifier's unit test; this is the one end-to-end case.
16. **Assert the code constant and the challenge scheme, never their literals.** The rejection body is
    asserted against the domain exception's own code attribute, so renaming the code moves both sides
    together; the challenge is asserted on its scheme only. The realm is app-specific and is never
    frozen in an assertion.

### Endpoint-level assertions

17. **A role-gated route is tested from below the bar as well as above it.** A happy path at the
    required rank, and a rejection at a lower one; a route whose gate is never exercised from below is
    a gate nothing proves.
18. **Where a resource is tenant-scoped, a test reads another tenant's row and asserts 404** —
    `hex-application` caller-derived rule 1; 403 would leak existence.

## Inlined typing / import rules

- The verifier unit test adds `cryptography.hazmat.*`, `myapp.domain.auth`, `myapp.domain.exceptions`
  and `myapp.infrastructure.jwt.*`; no `myapp.application.*` and no `myapp.restapi.*` — it drives the
  adapter directly.
- The api conftest adds `httpx`, `jwt` (PyJWT), `cryptography.hazmat.*`, `myapp.domain.auth` and
  `myapp.infrastructure.jwt.settings`; full annotations on the factory and its `_factory` closure.
- The probe adds `pytest`, `fastapi`, `fastapi.routing`, `httpx`, `myapp.restapi.main`,
  `myapp.domain.exceptions` for the `UnauthorizedError.code` constant it asserts against, and
  `myapp.infrastructure.jwt` with `tests.helpers.jwt` for the untrusted credential. It never imports `myapp.containers`: `create_app()` builds the real
  composition root itself, and no factory runs at collection time.
- Full annotations on every fixture, helper and test — `-> None` on every test. `python-style` owns
  annotation policy and admits no test carve-out.
- No `from __future__ import annotations`.

## Hard stops

- The app has no auth (every endpoint anonymous) → stop, produce none of these files: the probe's
  module-level imports would fail collection and take `tests/integration/api/` down with it, and the
  `container` of an auth-less app substitutes no verifier settings (`hex-test-integration-setup`).
- Nothing up-tree builds the app on the test's own infrastructure bindings (`real_app` under this
  catalogue's binding) → stop, use `hex-test-integration-setup`; the suite cannot collect without it.
- Asked for a per-endpoint anonymous-caller test (e.g. "test that POST /foos returns 401 unauth") →
  stop, write nothing; every operation not declared public is already probed. Making a route public
  adds it to the declaration.
- A per-resource row factory is added inside the api conftest → stop, use `hex-test-restapi-endpoint`;
  those live in `tests/integration/api/<resource>/conftest.py`.
