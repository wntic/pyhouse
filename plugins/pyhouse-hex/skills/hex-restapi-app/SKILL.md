description: Use when bootstrapping a FastAPI shell once per project, or changing request handling shared by every route — `restapi/main.py`, `restapi/error_handler.py`, `restapi/schemas/errors.py`, app lifecycle, CORS, middleware, central error translation and the HTTP status each error class maps to. Not one resource's router (`hex-restapi-endpoint`) or its wire models (`hex-restapi-schema`).

# Hex REST App

The shell every route lands inside, and the middleware layers that wrap it. The shell is laid once per project so subsequent work (`hex-restapi-endpoint`, `hex-restapi-schema`) has somewhere to go; a middleware is added whenever a cross-cutting per-request concern appears. After bootstrap, the only file this skill ever touches again is `restapi/main.py` (when a router or a middleware is registered), and a router's line is normally folded into the consuming skill.

## When to use vs. neighbours

- Laying the FastAPI entrypoint for the first time, or adding a middleware that wraps every route → this skill.
- A new router added afterwards, or logic for one route → `hex-restapi-endpoint`, a thin route over an application handler that also `app.include_router(...)`s itself.
- A resource's request/response models added into the `schemas/` package this skill creates → `hex-restapi-schema`.
- A new domain exception is plumbed → `exception-catalog` (creates/extends `domain/exceptions.py`); the HTTP status it answers with is this skill's `STATUS_BY_ERROR`, where a refinement needs no entry of its own.
- A middleware introducing a new HTTP status → this skill, *Registering a middleware's status* under `## Middleware`.
- Authenticating a caller or gating a route on a role → `hex-restapi-auth`; route auth is a FastAPI dependency, not a middleware, and it is optional — this shell is complete without it.
- Which error codes a route advertises → `hex-restapi-endpoint`.
- Constructing or extending the composition root this shell attaches → `hex-wiring`.
- Creating the application handlers routes receive from it → `hex-application`.
- Whether the service should be hexagonal at all → `architecture-choice`; the project substrate and dependencies around this shell, and the migration bootstrap where the service owns a relational schema → `hex-project-setup`; lint and type-check configuration → `python-toolchain`.
- An HTTP service with no rules of its own to protect — internal CRUD over its store, a webhook, a proxy → `flat-entrypoint`'s HTTP trigger shape, in the `pyhouse-flat` plugin, once `architecture-choice` has settled the family.
- Middleware class naming and the `restapi/middleware/` package layout → `naming` and `python-packaging`.
- The app-construction smoke test, the CORS-preflight and request-size-limit checks → `hex-test-app-invariants`.

**This is the app shell; per-resource work lands inside it.** Produced once per project. `hex-restapi-endpoint` and `hex-restapi-schema` add their routers and schema modules into the `main.py` / `schemas/` this skill creates, and the advertised codes in `hex-restapi-endpoint` extend routes the shell hosts — so the shell must already exist when they run. That is a structural precondition (the artifacts depend on the shell), not a fixed run-schedule this skill dictates. **The shell presumes no declared middleware** — no CORS, no request-size cap, no request id. The notes under `main.py` say where they are wired in, and the middleware section below is the form each one takes.

## Template(s) — FastAPI, dishka-wired, structlog logging

**The shell presumes no authentication.** The templates below are the complete file set for a service with no auth at all — a service whose routes need no caller identity: a public API, an internal worker-facing one, or one behind a gateway that passes nothing inward. The translator is a bare `MyappError` dispatcher with no auth import and no auth branch, and there is no `restapi/dependencies.py`: FastAPI's home for shared route dependencies has no occupant until something needs one. An app that declares auth adds what `hex-restapi-auth` states.

### `restapi/main.py`

```python
from collections.abc import AsyncGenerator
from contextlib import asynccontextmanager

from dishka import AsyncContainer
from dishka.integrations.fastapi import setup_dishka
from fastapi import FastAPI

from myapp.containers import create_container, resolve_settings
from myapp.logging import configure_logging

from .error_handler import UnexpectedErrorMiddleware, register_error_handlers

__all__ = ["create_app"]


@asynccontextmanager
async def _lifespan(app: FastAPI) -> AsyncGenerator[None]:
    container: AsyncContainer = app.state.dishka_container
    await resolve_settings(container)
    yield
    await container.close()


def create_app(container: AsyncContainer | None = None) -> FastAPI:
    configure_logging()
    app = FastAPI(title="myapp", lifespan=_lifespan)

    app.add_middleware(UnexpectedErrorMiddleware)
    register_error_handlers(app)

    setup_dishka(container=container or create_container(), app=app)
    return app
```

Notes:

- **`configure_logging()` runs first**, before the composition root is built — the process's one logging setup (`python-logging` rule 3), which `hex-project-setup` lays. The server is pointed at the factory (`uvicorn --factory myapp.restapi.main:create_app`), never at a module-level `app`, which would build the composition root at import; so the setup runs after the server has configured its own loggers and takes them over, and their records reach the one stream in its format. A process that builds the app itself passes the server `log_config=None`. Each test builds the app again, which rule 3 makes safe.
- **`lifespan` makes two calls into the composition root and nothing else.** On startup, `resolve_settings` — `hex-wiring`'s check that every settings class is built before the process serves, placed by rule 4 below — so a missing variable stops the process, uvicorn reporting the startup failure and exiting, instead of answering `500` on the first request that needs it; the construct smoke builds the app and never reaches it (`hex-test-app-invariants`). On shutdown, closing the composition root: each long-lived handle declares its own release beside its construction (`hex-wiring`) and runs in reverse order of construction, so this file never names a datastore or a settings class and never grows a per-app variant; an app that opens nothing disposable still closes cleanly.
- **The catch-all, `UnexpectedErrorMiddleware`, is added first**, which makes it the innermost layer: every declared middleware wraps it, so the failure it logs carries the logging context bound outside it, and its `500` leaves through every layer, CORS included, like any other response.
- **Where browsers call the API cross-origin, add `CORSMiddleware` last of the declared middleware, with every value from settings** — the outermost of them, so every response, a middleware's rejection included, carries its headers; never a literal origin, and never a `"*"` default, which is the deployment's decision made where it can no longer make it. A header a page's script must read, such as a download's `Content-Disposition`, is listed in its `expose_headers` setting.
- **No other middleware is presumed** — not even a request-size cap. A declared one is added after the catch-all and before CORS, all of them before the error handlers are registered (`## Middleware`). Starlette wraps the last-added outermost, and `setup_dishka` then adds dishka's scope middleware outside every declared one (rule 10).
- **`setup_dishka` is called last**, after the routers are included: it attaches the composition root to the app (as `app.state.dishka_container`) and installs the middleware that opens and closes a per-request scope. Every construction path must reach it before the app is served.
- **The `container` parameter is the test seam.** `hex-test-integration-setup`'s `real_app` add-on passes its `container` fixture — a composition root built with test bindings; production passes nothing and gets `create_container()`.
- **Routers are included between the error handlers and `setup_dishka`.** The template includes none; each `hex-restapi-endpoint` invocation adds its router's import at the top of the file and its own `app.include_router(...)` line there.

        return await _handle_domain_error(request, NotFoundError("no route serves this path"))
```

The translator stays minimal forever. New domain exceptions plug in without touching this file — the
handler renders the body off the attributes `exception-catalog` defines and takes the status from
`status_for`.

**The framework's own input rejection is translated, not left in the framework's shape.** FastAPI
rejects a malformed path parameter, query parameter or body before any route runs, and by default
answers with its own `{"detail": [...]}` body — a second error shape beside the `ErrorResponse` every
route advertises for the input-validation status (`hex-restapi-endpoint`). The request-validation
handler turns that rejection into the catalogue's `ValidationError` and hands it to the domain handler,
so it is rendered in the one place everything else is (`exception-catalog` rule 13) and logged there
once (`python-logging`), with the catalogue's code and the status it maps to. `context` names the rejected fields by
location (`body.name`, `path.id`) and never echoes the input values, which may carry a secret. It is a
translation of the framework's exception into the catalogue, not a branch in the translator, so rule 3's
cap is untouched.
This is why the shell needs `ValidationError` in the catalogue alongside `MyappError`.

**An unknown path is translated too.** The router answers a path no route serves with Starlette's
`HTTPException`, which the domain handler never receives, so it would leave in the framework's
`{"detail": ...}` shape and be logged nowhere. `_handle_unrouted` turns that `404` into the catalogue's
`NotFoundError` and hands it to the domain handler; a method the path does not serve (`405`) stays in the
framework's shape and is never advertised.

**An unexpected failure is caught in the ASGI layer, by `UnexpectedErrorMiddleware`**, because FastAPI's
handler for bare `Exception` re-raises to the server, which logs it a second time. The catch-all logs it
once and answers `INTERNAL_ERROR` itself; once the response has started no body can follow, so it
re-raises unlogged, and the server, which then drops the connection, logs it once.

**This module is the entrypoint's one error log** (`hex-architecture`, *Who logs, by layer*); it binds
`python-logging`'s level guide as 4xx → `warning`, 5xx and non-catalogue → `error`.

`INTERNAL_ERROR` is minted by no catalogue class, and deliberately so: by definition none was raised. It
is a constant of this template, not a new catalogue entry.

**The catalogue classes the shell and the routes need.** The root is the project's own (`MyappError`,
`exception-catalog`) and carries no status. `ValidationError` and `NotFoundError` serve the handlers
above, and `NotFoundError` `hex-restapi-endpoint`'s routes too; each class is added under `exception-catalog` only
when something raises it, and its status joins `STATUS_BY_ERROR` below in the same change —
`hex-restapi-auth` adds 401 and 403, a translated constraint 409.

### `restapi/schemas/errors.py`

```python
from typing import Any

from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

from myapp.domain.exceptions import MyappError, NotFoundError, ValidationError

__all__ = ["ErrorResponse", "MIDDLEWARE_ERRORS", "STATUS_BY_ERROR", "error_responses", "status_for"]


class ErrorResponse(BaseModel):
    code: str
    message: str
    context: dict[str, object] = Field(default_factory=dict)


STATUS_BY_ERROR: dict[type[MyappError], int] = {NotFoundError: 404, ValidationError: 422}

MIDDLEWARE_ERRORS: dict[str, int] = {"INTERNAL_ERROR": 500}


def status_for(exc: MyappError) -> int:
    return next((STATUS_BY_ERROR[cls] for cls in type(exc).__mro__ if cls in STATUS_BY_ERROR), 500)


def error_responses(*codes: int) -> dict[int | str, dict[str, Any]]:
    known = set(STATUS_BY_ERROR.values()) | set(MIDDLEWARE_ERRORS.values())
    unknown = [c for c in codes if c not in known]
    if unknown:
        raise ValueError(f"HTTP statuses no mapped error class or middleware produces: {unknown}")
    # Exactly FastAPI's `responses=` type; a narrower value type fails strict mypy at the decorator.
    out: dict[int | str, dict[str, Any]] = {c: {"model": ErrorResponse} for c in codes}
    return out
```

`STATUS_BY_ERROR` is the one place a catalogue class meets an HTTP status. `status_for` is `exception-catalog` rule 13's ancestry lookup, so a refinement (`FooNotFoundError`) needs no entry, and a class nothing maps answers `500`, as the root. The statuses a route may advertise are that map's values and `MIDDLEWARE_ERRORS`', `500` aside, which every route can produce.

A response entry carries no description: the framework fills in the status's standard phrase.

`MIDDLEWARE_ERRORS` registers the codes emitted with no catalogue class behind them. `INTERNAL_ERROR` is always present: the catch-all answers with it when no catalogue class was raised at all, and its entry pins the code string clients key on; `500` itself is never advertised (`hex-restapi-endpoint`). An entry is added when a declared middleware introduces a code (*Registering a middleware's status*, below) — a size cap's `PAYLOAD_TOO_LARGE` → 413.

This file is the **single source of truth** for the error wire-shape, the status map, the `error_responses(...)` helper and `MIDDLEWARE_ERRORS`. `hex-restapi-endpoint` only *references* it — it never writes to it or restates this template.

### `restapi/schemas/__init__.py`

```python
from . import errors
from .errors import *

__all__ = errors.__all__
```

Per-resource schema modules (e.g. `foos.py`) are added later by `hex-restapi-schema`. Each holds one resource's request and response models together — a closed set of declarations named for what it describes, which `python-packaging` lets share a module — and package updates follow `python-packaging`.

### `restapi/__init__.py`

```python
```

Empty file — see the entrypoint carve-out in `hex-architecture`.

## Middleware

ASGI middleware follows `naming` and `python-packaging` under `restapi/middleware/`, handling a
cross-cutting request/response concern that belongs to no single route — a correlation id, a body-size
cap, rate limiting, timing. That list is open, not a fixed catalog.

A middleware that rejects returns its error before awaiting the wrapped app; a pass-through one — a
request id bound into the logging context, a timer — always awaits it, and clears any per-request
context it set in a `finally`. A request-size cap, where the app declares one, is
`MaxRequestSizeMiddleware(app, max_bytes)` — the class name and keyword `hex-test-app-invariants` finds
it by — rejecting on the declared `Content-Length` with `PAYLOAD_TOO_LARGE`; a chunked body or a client
that misstates its length passes it, so the absolute ceiling belongs to the edge (*Other bindings*).

### How this binding spells the middleware obligations — raw ASGI, Starlette

Each line below is one obligation from `## Rules` in this stack's spelling; none of them is an
obligation of its own.

- **A raw ASGI class, the catch-all's form** (rule 7). `__init__(self, app: ASGIApp, <config…>)` stores `app` plus the config on
  `self`; `async def __call__(self, scope: Scope, receive: Receive, send: Send) -> None`. Configuration
  arrives as constructor keyword arguments passed at `app.add_middleware(Cls, **config)`, and the
  constructor validates them there.
- **Pass non-`http` scopes straight through** (rule 8) —
  `if scope["type"] != "http": await self._app(scope, receive, send); return`. Lifespan and websocket
  scopes must not be intercepted.
- **Reject before the wrapped app** (rule 9) — `return` **before** `await self._app(...)`, with the body
  built from `ErrorResponse`.
- **Starlette wraps the last-added outermost** (rule 10). Each `app.add_middleware(...)` call wraps the
  app as a new **outermost** layer, so of the middleware `create_app` declares, the **last** one added is
  the first to see a request and the last to touch a response — and `setup_dishka`, called after all of
  them, adds dishka's scope middleware outside every one.

### Registering a middleware's status

A status a middleware emits with no `MyappError` behind it — otherwise it is a class under
`exception-catalog` and an entry in `STATUS_BY_ERROR` — is added to `MIDDLEWARE_ERRORS` under its code
string before any route advertises it (`hex-restapi-endpoint`), and the middleware's `ErrorResponse`
carries that same code (rule 9).

## Other bindings

### Middleware

- **A framework with its own middleware abstraction** — Litestar, Django, or a decorator-based hook.
  Unchanged: transport-only scope, configuration fixed and validated at wiring time, the shared error
  body with a registered code, and a deliberate order. What changes: the class shape and how
  non-matching traffic is passed through.
- **A reverse proxy or gateway in front of the app.** A concern that is purely about bytes on the wire —
  a size ceiling, a request id — may live there instead of in the app, and then no middleware is written
  at all. Unchanged: the status it returns still needs a registered code if a client can see it
  (*Registering a middleware's status*, above), and the app keeps its own defence in depth where the edge can be
  bypassed.

### Dependency injection

- **`dependency-injector`.** The shell, the middleware order, the error handlers and the schemas are unchanged. What changes is the two ends of the composition root: `create_app` attaches it to `app.state` itself rather than calling an integration's setup function, and `_lifespan` must dispose each long-lived handle **by name** (`await container.engine().dispose()`) — which means this file grows a per-app teardown variant and has to be kept in step with what `containers.py` actually opened. That coupling is the reason the primary binding closes the composition root instead.

## Rules

1. **One-shot.** This skill runs once per project. After bootstrap, this file set is stable; updates to `main.py` go through whichever skill needs them (typically `hex-restapi-endpoint` appending an `include_router(...)` line).
2. **A route may advertise only a status `STATUS_BY_ERROR` or `MIDDLEWARE_ERRORS` holds, and never `500`**; the map is this boundary's, under `exception-catalog` rules 6 and 13.
3. **The translator stays minimal.** `restapi/error_handler.py` has **at most one** `isinstance` branch — the primary template this skill publishes has none, and an app that declares auth adds exactly one, for the RFC-7235 challenge (`hex-restapi-auth`). All other behaviour comes from the `MyappError` subclass and its mapped status, so new behaviour is a new subclass — and, where its status differs from its parent's, one map entry — never a new branch. The framework's own rejection of malformed input is translated into the catalogue's validation class, and its answer to an unknown path into the not-found class, each rendered by the same handler — a translation, not a second branch — so a route's advertised input-validation response is the body the client actually receives.
4. **`lifespan` runs `hex-wiring`'s settings check on startup and closes the composition root once on shutdown, and nothing else.** The check sits in the startup hook, not in building the app, because the server completes startup before it accepts a connection while building the app reads no environment. *What* the close releases is decided where each resource is constructed (`hex-wiring`), so `main.py` never names a datastore or a settings class. No business logic.
5. **`main.py` resolves nothing itself and never exposes the composition root for others to resolve from**; the startup check it calls is the composition root's own. How a route receives its handler is `hex-restapi-endpoint`'s.

6. **A middleware is transport-level and nothing else.** Bytes, headers, timing, the logging context.
   Anything that needs a domain entity, a repository or an application handler is not a middleware.
   Naming and module layout follow `naming` and `python-packaging`, under `restapi/middleware/` — all
   but the catch-all, which completes the error handlers in `error_handler.py`.
7. **A middleware's configuration is fixed and validated at wiring time.** It holds the wrapped
   application plus its configuration and nothing else, built once; every per-request value — the
   request id, the declared content length — is a local, never stored on the instance. A bad
   configuration value fails when the app is assembled, not mid-request.
8. **A middleware acts only on the kind of traffic it is for, and passes every other kind through
   untouched.** An HTTP concern must not intercept the framework's startup, shutdown or non-HTTP
   connections; a middleware that swallows one of those breaks a part of the app it was never about.
9. **A middleware that rejects a request emits the app's own error body, with a registered code.** Same
   `{"code", "message", "context"}` shape the central translator emits, built through the shared schema
   rather than hand-rolled, carrying the status it owns and a **stable** machine-readable code — the
   API contract and `MIDDLEWARE_ERRORS` in `schemas/errors.py` key on that string
   (`hex-restapi-endpoint`). A middleware that does not reject always reaches the wrapped app.
10. **The order middlewares see a request in is chosen, not inherited.** Which one sees the raw request
    first is a decision the app makes — a size cap has to see it before anything has read the body —
    and it is written according to whatever wrapping rule the framework applies to the order they are
    registered in. The relative order is the consuming app's decision; that it was decided is not.

## Inlined typing / import rules

- Middleware: ASGI types from `starlette.types` (`ASGIApp`, `Scope`, `Receive`, `Send`; add `Message` only
  when `__call__` wraps `receive` / `send`).
- A middleware that rejects emits its body through the shared
  `ErrorResponse` schema (`from ..schemas.errors import ErrorResponse`) — never hand-roll the
  `{"code", "message", "context"}` dict, so the wire shape stays single-sourced.
- Typing follows `python-style`, logging `python-logging`.

## Package wiring

For `restapi/__init__.py` and `restapi/middleware/__init__.py`, follow `python-packaging`, with the entrypoint carve-out in `hex-architecture`.

## Hard stops

- `domain/exceptions.py` does not exist yet → stop, use `exception-catalog` bootstrap first.
- `myapp/containers.py` does not exist yet → stop, use `hex-wiring` first.
- `lifespan` is asked to dispose a named engine or client → stop, declare that release beside the resource's construction in `hex-wiring`.
- A concern is for one route rather than all → stop, use `hex-restapi-endpoint` plus a handler.
- A middleware needs a domain entity, a repository or an application handler → stop, use `hex-application` for application logic.
- A middleware authenticates or authorizes → stop, use `hex-restapi-auth`; caller authentication is a route dependency, not a middleware.
